## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.

## Automation

We have an automatic link checker in place to help us detect broken links.
Your pull request will be checked by our bot that is running on TravisCI.
If everything is OK (all checks at the bottom of the PR page are green), there's nothing
to worry about.
It may however fail for the following reasons:

* Duplicate entry: Your link already exists in the file. In this case, please close your
  PR or let us know if there's a mistake.
* Redirection of link: Your link redirects somewhere else. In  this case, please use the
  final link after redirection.

Clicking on the failing build (a red x) will take you to the TravisCI website.
Look at the log to see what went wrong and what needs fixing.
If none of this makes sense to you, let us know and we'll come in and guide you along to
make the contribution a success.
